# Biographies of Presenters

## Raymond Speth

### Associate Director, Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, MIT

My research interests are in the development of sustainable energy technologies
for both stationary power generation and transportation needs. I have a
particular interest in the development of efficient numerical simulation tools
which can be used to assess the impacts of energy use and solve problems in
these areas. I am the lead developer of Cantera, an open-source chemical
kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport package. I am also the author of Ember,
a tool for simulating flames and studying flame/flow interactions.

## Steven DeCaluwe

### Assistant Professor, Mechanical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines

Dr. DeCaluwe comes to the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Mines after
completing a National Research Council post-doctoral fellowship at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Dr. DeCaluwe’s work at NIST
utilized neutron reflectometry experiments to study solid electrolyte interphase
formation in Lithium-ion batteries and water uptake in thin-film polymers for
PEM fuel cells. His work at CSM focuses on interfacial studies of
electrochemical energy systems, in particular the use of in situ measurements to
validate and assist in scale-up of atomistic models. Dr. DeCaluwe is one of the
lead developers of Cantera.

## Bryan Weber

### Assistant Professor in Residence, Mechanical Engineering, University of Connecticut

Dr. Weber’s research interests are on the combustion of alternative biofuels
including alcohols and biodiesel, design of novel experimental methods for
combustion analysis, and computational analysis of reaction mechanisms for
combustion. Dr. Weber is one of the lead developers of Cantera.
