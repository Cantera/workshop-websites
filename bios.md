## Biographies of Presenters

### Raymond Speth

#### Associate Director, Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, MIT

My research interests are in the development of sustainable energy technologies for both stationary power generation and transportation needs. I have a particular interest in the development of efficient numerical simulation tools which can be used to assess the impacts of energy use and solve problems in these areas. I am the lead developer of Cantera, an open-source chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport package. I am also the author of Ember, a tool for simulating flames and studying flame/flow interactions.

### Steven DeCaluwe

#### Assistant Professor, Mechanical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines

Dr. DeCaluwe comes to the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Mines after completing a National Research Council post-doctoral fellowship at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Dr. DeCaluwe’s work at NIST utilized neutron reflectometry experiments to study solid electrolyte interphase formation in Lithium-ion batteries and water uptake in thin-film polymers for PEM fuel cells. His work at CSM focuses on interfacial studies of electrochemical energy systems, in particular the use of in situ measurements to validate and assist in scale-up of atomistic models. Dr. DeCaluwe is one of the lead developers of Cantera.

### Bryan Weber

#### Assistant Professor in Residence, Mechanical Engineering, University of Connecticut

Dr. Weber’s research interests are on the combustion of alternative biofuels including alcohols and biodiesel, design of novel experimental methods for combustion analysis, and computational analysis of reaction mechanisms for combustion. Dr. Weber is one of the lead developers of Cantera.
