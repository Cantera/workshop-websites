## Biographies of Presenters

### Kyle Niemeyer

#### Associate Professor, Mechanical Engineering, Oregon State University

Dr. Niemeyer is Associate Professor in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. He leads the [Niemeyer Research Group](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io), which performs research into numerical modeling of reacting and non-reacting fluid systems, and also into using modern, highly parallel computing systems for tackling challenging problems related to energy and the environment.

### Richard West

#### Associate Professor, Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University

Dr. West is Associate Professor and Associate Chair for Graduate Studies in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University. He leads the [Computational Modeling in Chemical Engineering (CoMoChEng)](https://web.northeastern.edu/comocheng/) group, which performs research into the development of detailed microkinetic models for complex reacting systems, like combustion, heterogeneous catalysis, and bio-fuel processing. 



### Patrick Meagher

#### Ph.D. candidate, Mechanical Engineering, University of Connecticut

Patrick joined the [Computational Thermal Fluids Laboratory at the University of Connecticut (CTF@UConn)](https://xyzrg.engr.uconn.edu/) in Spring 2019, working as an undergraduate research assistant. He then graduated from UConn as Summa Cum Laude and officially joined CTF@UConn as a graduate student in Fall 2020.
