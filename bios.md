## Biographies of Presenters

### Ray Speth

#### Research Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Dr. Speth a Research Scientist in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Associate Director of the MIT Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment
He has a particular interest in the development of efficient numerical simulation tools and is the lead developer of the [Cantera](https://cantera.org) software package, which is used for solving problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.


### Richard West

#### Associate Professor, Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University

Dr. West is Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University. He leads the [Computational Modeling in Chemical Engineering (CoMoChEng)](https://comocheng.sites.northeastern.edu) group, which performs research into the development of detailed microkinetic models for complex reacting systems, like combustion, heterogeneous catalysis, and bio-fuel processing.


### Kyle Niemeyer

#### Associate Professor, Mechanical Engineering, Oregon State University

Dr. Niemeyer is Associate Professor in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. He leads the [Niemeyer Research Group](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io), which performs research into numerical modeling of reacting and non-reacting fluid systems, and also into using modern, highly parallel computing systems for tackling challenging problems related to energy and the environment.
