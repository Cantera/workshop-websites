## Schedule

**This tentative schedule is subject to change.**

The workshop will run 9 AM to 6 PM on Sunday 16 March, with a meet-up the evening before from 7pm at Back Bay Social for those arriving earlier on Saturday.
The Sunday morning session will be an introduction and tutorial (bring a laptop to follow along and try things out).
Around lunch we invite lightning talks from attendees (show off what you have tried to do with Cantera, or what you would *like* to do with Cantera), and will have a session on how to contribute to Cantera.
The afternoon will be a presentation of what's new in Cantera, including demonstrations of the latest features and capabilities.
