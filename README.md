## Friday 22 July to Saturday 23 July 2022

## In-person workshop

Cantera is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

This 1.5-day workshop will bring together new and advanced users of Cantera, and introduce all to getting involved with with Cantera development. 

The workshop will begin on Friday afternoon with a session on advanced use of Cantera, and then Saturday morning will introduce basic use of Cantera. All workshop attendees are invited to join a code sprint and poster session on Saturday afternoon. Attendees can choose to attend the basic or advanced sessions, or both.

Everyone is welcome, and we especially encourage new users to attend! Registration will be conducted through [EventBrite]().

All participants in the workshop are expected to ready and comply with our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), both during the workshop and in any communications associated with it before, during, or after the event itself.
