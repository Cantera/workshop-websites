## Sunday, May 23

## Virtual Online

Cantera is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

This Workshop will cover basic and advanced usage of Cantera and getting started with Cantera development. The Workshop will be hosted by the lead developers of Cantera.

Everyone is welcome, and we especially encourage new users to attend! Registration will be conducted through [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/H5Fip7sHfQeo4vZX7). There is no fee to register for or attend the workshop!
