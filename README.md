## Sunday 16 March 2025

[Cantera](https://www.cantera.org/) is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

This day-long workshop affiliated with the [14th U.S. National Combustion Meeting](https://www.combustioninstitute.org/ci-event/14th-united-states-national-combustion-meeting/) will bring together new and advanced users of Cantera, and introduce all to getting involved with Cantera development.

The workshop will run all day on Sunday 16 March, with a meet-up the evening before for those arriving earlier on Saturday.
The Sunday morning session will be an introduction and tutorial (bring a laptop to follow along and try things out).
After lunch we invite lightning talks from attendees (show off what you have tried to do with Cantera, or what you would *like* to do with Cantera), and will have a session on how to contribute to Cantera.
The afternoon will be a presentation of what's new in Cantera, including demonstrations of the latest features and capabilities.
See more detail on the [Schedule page](content.md).


### Registration

Everyone is welcome, and we especially encourage new users to attend! 

Registration is made through the Combustion Institute when registering for the [14th U.S. National Combustion Meeting](https://www.combustioninstitute.org/ci-event/14th-united-states-national-combustion-meeting/).
Places are limited to 60 participants, so please register early to avoid disappointment.
Early Registration Opens  October 9, 2024.

Participants will be invited to present a lightning talk; though this is not required, we encourage everyone to present on the work they are doing that either already uses Cantera or might benefit from using Cantera. This will be a great way to network with other users and generate ideas.

### Venue

The workshop will be held in downtown Boston, just a [1 mile walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j8JTC4QTqYWaPtMJ8) from the Conference Hotel, at [Northeastern University](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tsvobBMr1gMYVfDr8).

### Code of Conduct

All participants in the workshop are expected to ready and comply with our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), both during the workshop and in any communications associated with it before, during, or after the event itself.
