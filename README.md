## Friday 22 July and Saturday 23 July 2022

[Cantera](https://www.cantera.org/) is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

This 1.5-day workshop affiliated with the [39th International Symposium on Combustion](http://www.combustionsymposia.org/2022/) will bring together new and advanced users of Cantera, and introduce all to getting involved with Cantera development.

The workshop will begin on Friday afternoon with a session on advanced use of Cantera, and then Saturday morning will introduce basic use of Cantera.
All workshop attendees are invited to join a code sprint and poster session on Saturday afternoon.
See more detail on the [Schedule page](content.md).
Attendees can choose to attend the basic or advanced sessions, or both.
You may also register for the poster session on Saturday afternoon without either of the tutorial sessions, if you wish to engage with the Cantera community but do not anticipate using it yourself (eg. lab directors, supervisors).

### Registration

Everyone is welcome, and we especially encourage new users to attend! 

**[Please register here via EventBrite.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cantera-workshop-at-the-39th-international-symposium-on-combustion-tickets-278311094977)**

When registering, the "base" ticket gets you into the Saturday afternoon code sprint and poster sessions. Then, you can choose between Friday afternoon or Saturday morning "add on" options, or both.

All participants will have the option of presenting a poster; though this is not required, we encourage everyone to present on the work they are doing that either already uses Cantera or might benefit from using Cantera. This will be a great way to network with other users and generate ideas.

### Venue

The workshop will be held in downtown Vancouver, just 1km from the [Combustion Symposium](http://www.combustionsymposia.org/2022/)'s Convention Center, at [Northeastern University â€” Vancouver](https://g.page/NortheasternVAN?share), 410 West Georgia Street #1400, Vancouver, BC V6B 1Z3, Canada.

### Code of Conduct

All participants in the workshop are expected to ready and comply with our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), both during the workshop and in any communications associated with it before, during, or after the event itself.
