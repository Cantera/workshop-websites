## Sunday 16 March 2025

[Cantera](https://www.cantera.org/) is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

This day-long workshop affiliated with the [14th U.S. National Combustion Meeting](https://members.combustioninstitute.org/Calendar/moreinfo.php?org_id=CMBI&eventid=140463) will bring together new and advanced users of Cantera, and introduce all to getting involved with Cantera development.

The workshop will run all day on Sunday 16 March, with a meet-up at Back Bay Social Club 7pm the evening before for those arriving earlier on Saturday.
The Sunday morning session will be an introduction and tutorial (bring a laptop to follow along and try things out).
Either side of lunch we invite lightning talks from attendees (show off what you have tried to do with Cantera, or what you would *like* to do with Cantera), and will have a session on how to contribute to Cantera.
The afternoon will be a presentation of what's new in Cantera, including demonstrations of the latest features and capabilities.
See more detail on the [Schedule page](content.md).


### Registration

Everyone is welcome, and we especially encourage new users to attend! 

Registration is made through the Combustion Institute when registering for the [14th U.S. National Combustion Meeting](https://members.combustioninstitute.org/Calendar/moreinfo.php?org_id=CMBI&eventid=140463).
Places are limited to 60 participants, so please register early to avoid disappointment.
Registration Opens  October 9, 2024. Discounted "Early" registration is until January 23, 2025. [Register Here](https://combustioninstitute.wixsite.com/14th-usncm/registration).

Participants will be invited to present a lightning talk; though this is not required, we encourage everyone to present on the work they are doing that either already uses Cantera or might benefit from using Cantera. This will be a great way to network with other users and generate ideas.

### Venue

The workshop will be held in Shillman Hall at [Northeastern University](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WV1CugQver2HRZWD8) in downtown Boston, just a [1 mile walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8wTsF3BRpwEgaSYE9) from the Westin Copley Place [Conference Hotel](https://book.passkey.com/event/50805700/owner/251/home).

### Accommodation

Participants in the workshop are invited to use the conference's [discounted room rate](https://book.passkey.com/event/50805700/owner/251/home) of $285/night for all events related to the conference. It is valid from Saturday 15th March.

### Code of Conduct

All participants in the workshop are expected to ready and comply with our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), both during the workshop and in any communications associated with it before, during, or after the event itself.
